**Association football**, more commonly known as **football** or **soccer**,[\[a\]](#cite_note-5) is a [team sport](/wiki/Team_sport "Team sport") played between two teams of 11 [players](/wiki/Football_player "Football player") each, who primarily use their feet to propel a [ball](/wiki/Ball_\(association_football\) "Ball (association football)") around a rectangular field called a [pitch](/wiki/Football_pitch "Football pitch"). The objective of the game is to [score](/wiki/Scoring_in_association_football "Scoring in association football") more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed [goal](/wiki/Goal_\(sport\) "Goal (sport)") defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.

The game of association football is played in accordance with the [Laws of the Game](/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_\(association_football\) "Laws of the Game (association football)"), a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the [IFAB](/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board "International Football Association Board") since 1886. The game is played with a [football](/wiki/Ball_\(association_football\) "Ball (association football)") that is 68‚Äì70¬†cm (27‚Äì28¬†in) in [circumference](/wiki/Circumference "Circumference"). The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the [goalkeepers](/wiki/Goalkeeper_\(association_football\) "Goalkeeper (association football)") may use their hands and arms, and only then within the [penalty area](/wiki/Penalty_area "Penalty area"). The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an offside call or a foul in the build-up to the goal. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a [draw](/wiki/Tie_\(draw\)#Association_football "Tie (draw)") being declared, or the game goes into [extra time](/wiki/Overtime_\(sports\)#Association_football "Overtime (sports)") or a [penalty shoot-out](/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_\(association_football\) "Penalty shoot-out (association football)").[\[5\]](#cite_note-laws51-52-6)

Internationally, association football is governed by [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA "FIFA"). Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: [AFC](/wiki/Asian_Football_Confederation "Asian Football Confederation"), [CAF](/wiki/Confederation_of_African_Football "Confederation of African Football"), [CONCACAF](/wiki/CONCACAF "CONCACAF"), [CONMEBOL](/wiki/CONMEBOL "CONMEBOL"), [OFC](/wiki/Oceania_Football_Confederation "Oceania Football Confederation"), and [UEFA](/wiki/UEFA "UEFA"). Of these confederations, CONMEBOL is the oldest one, being founded in 1916. National associations (e.g. [The FA](/wiki/The_FA "The FA") or [JFA](/wiki/Japan_Football_Association "Japan Football Association")) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup") and the [FIFA Women's World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "FIFA Women's World Cup"). The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the [Olympic Games](/wiki/Olympic_Games "Olympic Games").[\[6\]](#cite_note-7) The two most prestigious competitions in European club football are the [UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League "UEFA Champions League") and the [UEFA Women's Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Women%27s_Champions_League "UEFA Women's Champions League"), which attract an extensive television audience throughout the world. Since 2009, the final of the men's tournament has been the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)

Main article: [Names for association football](/wiki/Names_for_association_football "Names for association football")

Association football is one of a family of [football](/wiki/Football "Football") codes that emerged from various [ball games](/wiki/Ball_games "Ball games") played worldwide since antiquity. Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called "football" in Great Britain and most of [Ulster](/wiki/Ulster "Ulster") in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it "soccer" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9) Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster),[\[9\]](#cite_note-10) and the United States. A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, "football" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely [rugby union](/wiki/Rugby_union "Rugby union") and [rugby league](/wiki/Rugby_league "Rugby league").[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)

The term _soccer_ comes from [Oxford "-er"](/wiki/Oxford_%22-er%22 "Oxford \"-er\"") slang, which was prevalent at the [University of Oxford](/wiki/University_of_Oxford "University of Oxford") in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of [Rugby School](/wiki/Rugby_School "Rugby School"). Initially spelt _assoccer_ (a shortening of "association"), it was later reduced to the modern spelling.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)[\[12\]](#cite_note-13) This form of slang also gave rise to _rugger_ for rugby football, _fiver_ and _tenner_ for [five pound](/wiki/Five_pound_note "Five pound note") and [ten pound notes](/wiki/Bank_of_England_%C2%A310_note "Bank of England ¬£10 note"), and the now-archaic _footer_ that was also a name for association football.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14) The word _soccer_ arrived at its current form in 1895 and was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of _socca_.[\[14\]](#cite_note-15)

Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures.[\[b\]](#cite_note-17) The Chinese competitive game __[cuju](/wiki/Cuju "Cuju")__ (Ëπ¥Èû†, literally "kick ball"; also known as _tsu chu_) resembles modern association football as well as a mix of basketball, and volleyball.

It was then passed to a designated player, who attempted to kick it through the fengliu yan, a circular goal atop 10-11 meter poles.[\[19\]](#cite_note-21) During the [Han dynasty](/wiki/Han_dynasty "Han dynasty") (206 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE), __cuju__ games were standardised and rules were established.[\[20\]](#cite_note-abd-22) Cuju and other ancient games demonstrate humanity‚Äôs innate predisposition to play with a ball.[\[21\]](#cite_note-23) The [Silk Road](/wiki/Silk_Road "Silk Road") facilitated the transmission of _cuju_, especially the game popular in the [Tang dynasty](/wiki/Tang_dynasty "Tang dynasty"), the period when the [inflatable](/wiki/Inflatable "Inflatable") ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[\[22\]](#cite_note-24) Other East Asian games included __[kemari](/wiki/Kemari "Kemari")__ in Japan and __chuk-guk__ in Korea, both influenced by _cuju_.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)[\[24\]](#cite_note-26) __Kemari__ originated after the year 600 during the [Asuka period](/wiki/Asuka_period "Asuka period"). It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a _mari_, a ball made of animal skin.[\[25\]](#cite_note-histbleacher-27) In North America, _[pasuckuakohowog](/wiki/Pasuckuakohowog "Pasuckuakohowog")_ was a ball game played by the [Algonquians](/wiki/Algonquian_peoples "Algonquian peoples"); it was described as "almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals".[\[26\]](#cite_note-roberts-28)

Association football in itself does not have a classical history.[\[28\]](#cite_note-bangkokpost-30) Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world, FIFA has described that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.[\[36\]](#cite_note-38) The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century.[\[37\]](#cite_note-39) The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely [varying forms of football](/wiki/English_public_school_football_games "English public school football games") played in the [public schools](/wiki/Public_school_\(United_Kingdom\) "Public school (United Kingdom)") of England.

The "Laws of the University Foot Ball Club" (_Cambridge Rules_) of 1856

The [Cambridge rules](/wiki/Cambridge_rules "Cambridge rules"), first drawn up at the [University of Cambridge](/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge rules were written at [Trinity College, Cambridge](/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge "Trinity College, Cambridge"), at a meeting attended by representatives from [Eton](/wiki/Eton_College "Eton College"), [Harrow](/wiki/Harrow_School "Harrow School"), [Rugby](/wiki/Rugby_School "Rugby School"), [Winchester](/wiki/Winchester_College "Winchester College") and [Shrewsbury](/wiki/Shrewsbury_School "Shrewsbury School") schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [Sheffield Football Club](/wiki/Sheffield_F.C. "Sheffield F.C."), formed by former public school pupils in 1857,[\[38\]](#cite_note-40) which led to the formation of a [Sheffield FA](/wiki/Sheffield_%26_Hallamshire_Football_Association "Sheffield & Hallamshire Football Association") in 1867. In 1862, [John Charles Thring](/wiki/John_Charles_Thring "John Charles Thring") of [Uppingham School](/wiki/Uppingham_School "Uppingham School") also devised an influential set of rules.[\[39\]](#cite_note-41)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Original_laws_of_the_game_1863.jpg/220px-Original_laws_of_the_game_1863.jpg)](/wiki/File:Original_laws_of_the_game_1863.jpg)

An early draft of the original hand-written 'Laws of the Game' drawn up on behalf of [The Football Association](/wiki/The_Football_Association "The Football Association") by [Ebenezer Cobb Morley](/wiki/Ebenezer_Cobb_Morley "Ebenezer Cobb Morley") in 1863 on display at the [National Football Museum](/wiki/National_Football_Museum "National Football Museum"), Manchester, England

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of [The Football Association](/wiki/The_Football_Association "The Football Association") (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the [Freemasons' Tavern](/wiki/Freemasons%27_Tavern "Freemasons' Tavern") in [Great Queen Street](/wiki/Great_Queen_Street "Great Queen Street"), London.[\[40\]](#cite_note-FAhistory-42) The only school to be represented on this occasion was [Charterhouse](/wiki/Charterhouse_School "Charterhouse School"). The Freemasons' Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of The FA between October and December 1863; the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named [Laws of the Game](#Laws_of_the_Game), forming modern football.[\[41\]](#cite_note-BLibrary-43) The laws included bans on running with the ball in hand and [hacking](/wiki/Hacking_\(rugby\) "Hacking (rugby)") (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding.[\[42\]](#cite_note-nov_24-44) Eleven clubs, under the charge of FA secretary [Ebenezer Cobb Morley](/wiki/Ebenezer_Cobb_Morley "Ebenezer Cobb Morley"), ratified the original thirteen laws of the game.[\[40\]](#cite_note-FAhistory-42) The sticking point was hacking, which a twelfth club at the meeting, [Blackheath FC](/wiki/Blackheath_FC "Blackheath FC"), had wanted to keep, resulting in them withdrawing from the FA.[\[40\]](#cite_note-FAhistory-42) Other [English rugby clubs followed this lead](/wiki/History_of_rugby_union "History of rugby union") and did not join the FA, and instead in 1871, along with Blackheath, formed the [Rugby Football Union](/wiki/Rugby_Football_Union "Rugby Football Union"). The FA rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to [Victorian rules football](/wiki/Australian_rules_football "Australian rules football") being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.[\[43\]](#cite_note-Merger-45)

The [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. "Aston Villa F.C.") team in 1897, after winning both the [FA Cup](/wiki/FA_Cup "FA Cup") and the [English Football League](/wiki/English_Football_League "English Football League")

The world's oldest football competition is the [FA Cup](/wiki/FA_Cup "FA Cup"), which was founded by the footballer and cricketer [Charles W. Alcock](/wiki/Charles_W._Alcock "Charles W. Alcock"), and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The [first official international football match](/wiki/1872_Scotland_v_England_football_match "1872 Scotland v England football match") also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in [Glasgow](/wiki/Glasgow "Glasgow"), again at the instigation of Alcock. England is also home to the world's first [football league](/wiki/The_Football_League "The Football League"), which was founded in [Birmingham](/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham") in 1888 by [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. "Aston Villa F.C.") director [William McGregor](/wiki/William_McGregor_\(football\) "William McGregor (football)").[\[44\]](#cite_note-46) The original format contained 12 clubs from the [Midlands](/wiki/English_Midlands "English Midlands") and [Northern England](/wiki/Northern_England "Northern England").[\[45\]](#cite_note-47)

Laws of the Game are determined by the [International Football Association Board](/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board "International Football Association Board") (IFAB).[\[46\]](#cite_note-48) The board was formed in 1886[\[47\]](#cite_note-49) after a meeting in [Manchester](/wiki/Manchester "Manchester") of the Football Association, the [Scottish Football Association](/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association "Scottish Football Association"), the [Football Association of Wales](/wiki/Football_Association_of_Wales "Football Association of Wales"), and the [Irish Football Association](/wiki/Irish_Football_Association "Irish Football Association"). [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA "FIFA"), the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Wherebegan-50) The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.[\[49\]](#cite_note-FIFA-51)

For most of the 20th century, [Europe](/wiki/Football_in_Europe "Football in Europe") and [South America](/wiki/Football_in_South_America "Football in South America") were the dominant regions in association football. The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in [1930](/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup "1930 FIFA World Cup"), became the main stage for players of both continents to show their worth and the strength of their national teams.[\[50\]](#cite_note-:continental_kings-52) In the second half of the century, the [European Cup](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League "UEFA Champions League") and the [Copa Libertadores](/wiki/Copa_Libertadores "Copa Libertadores") were created, and the champions of these two club competitions would contest the [Intercontinental Cup](/wiki/Intercontinental_Cup_\(football\) "Intercontinental Cup (football)") to prove which team was the best in the world.[\[51\]](#cite_note-53)

In the 21st century, South America has continued to produce some of the best [footballers](/wiki/Football_player "Football player") in the world,[\[52\]](#cite_note-:euro_and_south-54) but its clubs have fallen behind the still dominant European clubs, which often sign the best players from [Latin America](/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America") and elsewhere.[\[50\]](#cite_note-:continental_kings-52)[\[52\]](#cite_note-:euro_and_south-54) Meanwhile, football has improved in [Africa](/wiki/Football_in_Africa "Football in Africa"), [Asia](/wiki/Football_in_Asia "Football in Asia") and [North America](/wiki/Sports_in_North_America#Association_football_\(soccer\) "Sports in North America"),[\[52\]](#cite_note-:euro_and_south-54) and nowadays, these regions are at least on equal grounds with South America in club football,[\[53\]](#cite_note-55) although countries in the [Caribbean](/wiki/Sport_in_the_Caribbean "Sport in the Caribbean") and [Oceania](/wiki/Sport_in_Oceania#Association_football "Sport in Oceania") regions (except [Australia](/wiki/Soccer_in_Australia "Soccer in Australia")) have yet to make a mark in international football.[\[54\]](#cite_note-56)[\[55\]](#cite_note-57) When it comes to men's national teams, Europeans and South Americans continue to dominate the FIFA World Cup, as no team from any other region has managed to even reach the final.[\[50\]](#cite_note-:continental_kings-52)[\[52\]](#cite_note-:euro_and_south-54) These regional trends do not hold true for the women's game, as the [United States women‚Äôs national team](/w/index.php?title=United_States_women%E2%80%99s_national_soccer_team&action=edit&redlink=1 "United States women‚Äôs national soccer team (page does not exist)") has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times, more than any other women's team.[\[56\]](#cite_note-58)

Football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams,[\[57\]](#cite_note-59) while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet.[\[58\]](#cite_note-billions-60)[\[59\]](#cite_note-billions2-61) A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.[\[60\]](#cite_note-62) Football has the highest global television audience in sport.[\[61\]](#cite_note-63)

In many parts of the world, football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual [fans](/wiki/Fan_\(aficionado\) "Fan (aficionado)"), local communities, and even nations. [Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski](/wiki/Ryszard_Kapu%C5%9Bci%C5%84ski "Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski") says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games.[\[62\]](#cite_note-soccer_war-64) The [Ivory Coast national football team](/wiki/Ivory_Coast_national_football_team "Ivory Coast national football team") helped secure a truce to the nation's [civil war](/wiki/First_Ivorian_Civil_War "First Ivorian Civil War") in 2006[\[63\]](#cite_note-65) and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of [Bouak√©](/wiki/Bouak%C3%A9 "Bouak√©"), an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time.[\[64\]](#cite_note-66) By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the [Football War](/wiki/Football_War "Football War") in June 1969 between [El Salvador](/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador") and [Honduras](/wiki/Honduras "Honduras").[\[65\]](#cite_note-67) The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the [Croatian War of Independence](/wiki/Croatian_War_of_Independence "Croatian War of Independence") of the 1990s, when a match between [Dinamo Zagreb](/wiki/NK_Dinamo_Zagreb "NK Dinamo Zagreb") and [Red Star Belgrade](/wiki/Red_Star_Belgrade "Red Star Belgrade") degenerated into [rioting](/wiki/Dinamo%E2%80%93Red_Star_riot "Dinamo‚ÄìRed Star riot") in May 1990.[\[66\]](#cite_note-68)

Main article: [Women's association football](/wiki/Women%27s_association_football "Women's association football")

Women's association football has historically seen opposition, with national associations severely curbing its development and several [outlawing it](/wiki/Bans_of_women%27s_association_football "Bans of women's association football") completely. Women may have been playing football for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that a similar ancient game (_cuju_, or [_tsu chu_](/wiki/Tsu_Chu "Tsu Chu")) was played by women during the [Han dynasty](/wiki/Han_dynasty#Eastern_Han "Han dynasty") (25‚Äì220 CE), as female figures are depicted in frescoes of the period playing _tsu chu_.[\[67\]](#cite_note-globalgame-69)[\[68\]](#cite_note-footballnetwork-70) There are also reports of annual football matches played by women in [Midlothian](/wiki/Midlothian "Midlothian"), Scotland, during the 1790s.[\[69\]](#cite_note-SFA-71)[\[70\]](#cite_note-Herald-72)

North team of the [British Ladies'](/wiki/British_Ladies%27_Football_Club "British Ladies' Football Club"), the first organised women's football team, here pictured in March 1895

Association football, the modern game, has documented early involvement of women.[\[70\]](#cite_note-Herald-72) In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.[\[71\]](#cite_note-FA-73) The first match recorded by the [Scottish Football Association](/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association "Scottish Football Association") took place in 1892 in [Glasgow](/wiki/Glasgow "Glasgow").[\[69\]](#cite_note-SFA-71) In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.[\[71\]](#cite_note-FA-73) Women's football has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.[\[72\]](#cite_note-BBC-Gregory-74)

Association football continued to be played by women since the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.[\[72\]](#cite_note-BBC-Gregory-74)[\[73\]](#cite_note-75) The best-documented early European team was founded by activist [Nettie Honeyball](/wiki/Nettie_Honeyball "Nettie Honeyball") in England in 1894. It was named the [British Ladies' Football Club](/wiki/British_Ladies%27_Football_Club "British Ladies' Football Club"). Honeyball is quoted as, "I founded the association late last year \[1894\], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of [emancipation](/wiki/Feminism "Feminism"), and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in [Parliament](/wiki/Parliament "Parliament") and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most."[\[74\]](#cite_note-Nettie_Honeyball-76) Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the "masculinity" of the game.[\[75\]](#cite_note-77)

Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the [First World War](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), when female employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men 50 years earlier. The most successful team of the era was [Dick, Kerr Ladies F.C.](/wiki/Dick,_Kerr_Ladies_F.C. "Dick, Kerr Ladies F.C.") of [Preston, England](/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire "Preston, Lancashire"). The team played in one of the first women's international matches against a French XI team in 1920,[\[76\]](#cite_note-78)[\[77\]](#cite_note-79) and also made up most of the England team against a [Scottish Ladies](/wiki/Women%27s_football_in_Scotland "Women's football in Scotland") XI in the same year, winning 22‚Äì0.[\[69\]](#cite_note-SFA-71)

Despite being more popular than some men's football events, with one match seeing a 53,000 strong crowd in 1920,[\[78\]](#cite_note-80)[\[79\]](#cite_note-BBC-Alexander-81) [women's football in England](/wiki/Women%27s_football_in_England "Women's football in England") suffered a blow in 1921 when [The Football Association](/wiki/The_Football_Association "The Football Association") outlawed the playing of the game on association members' pitches,[\[80\]](#cite_note-82) stating that "the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged."[\[81\]](#cite_note-BBC-Wrack-83) Players and football writers have argued that this ban was, in fact, due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted,[\[79\]](#cite_note-BBC-Alexander-81) and because the FA had no control over the money made from the women's game.[\[81\]](#cite_note-BBC-Wrack-83) The FA ban led to the formation of the short-lived [English Ladies Football Association](/wiki/English_Ladies_Football_Association "English Ladies Football Association") and play moved to [rugby](/wiki/Rugby_football "Rugby football") grounds.[\[82\]](#cite_note-84) Women's football also faced bans in [several other countries](/wiki/Bans_of_women%27s_association_football "Bans of women's association football"), notably in [Brazil](/wiki/Women%27s_football_in_Brazil "Women's football in Brazil") from 1941 to 1979,[\[83\]](#cite_note-85) in [France](/wiki/Women%27s_football_in_France "Women's football in France") from 1941 to 1970,[\[84\]](#cite_note-86) and in [Germany](/wiki/Women%27s_football_in_Germany "Women's football in Germany") from 1955 to 1970.[\[85\]](#cite_note-87)

The [Italian women's football league](/wiki/Serie_A_\(women%27s_football\) "Serie A (women's football)") was established in 1968.[\[86\]](#cite_note-88) In December 1969, the [Women's Football Association](/wiki/Women%27s_Football_Association "Women's Football Association") was formed in England,[\[72\]](#cite_note-BBC-Gregory-74)[\[87\]](#cite_note-Hist-89) with the sport eventually becoming the most prominent [team sport](/wiki/Team_sport "Team sport") for women in the United Kingdom.[\[72\]](#cite_note-BBC-Gregory-74) Two unofficial women's World Cups were organised by the [FIEFF](/wiki/FIEFF "FIEFF") [in 1970](/wiki/1970_Women%27s_World_Cup "1970 Women's World Cup") and [in 1971](/wiki/1971_Women%27s_World_Cup "1971 Women's World Cup"). Also in 1971, Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) members voted to officially recognise women's football,[\[72\]](#cite_note-BBC-Gregory-74) while The Football Association rescinded the ban that prohibited women from playing on association members' pitches in England.[\[87\]](#cite_note-Hist-89)

Women's football still faces many struggles, but its worldwide growth[\[88\]](#cite_note-90) has seen major competitions being launched at both the [national](/wiki/Women%27s_football_around_the_world "Women's football around the world") and [international](/wiki/International_competitions_in_women%27s_football "International competitions in women's football") levels, mirroring the men's competitions. The [FIFA Women's World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "FIFA Women's World Cup") was inaugurated in 1991: the first tournament [was held in China](/wiki/1991_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "1991 FIFA Women's World Cup"), featuring 12 teams from the respective six confederations. The World Cup has been held every four years since;[\[89\]](#cite_note-91) by the [2019 FIFA Women's World Cup](/wiki/2019_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "2019 FIFA Women's World Cup") in France, it had expanded to 24 national teams, and 1.12 billion viewers watched the competition.[\[90\]](#cite_note-forbes_2019wwc-92) Women's football has been an Olympic event [since 1996](/wiki/Football_at_the_1996_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_tournament "Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Women's tournament").[\[91\]](#cite_note-93)

North America is the dominant region in women's football, with the [United States](/wiki/United_States_women%27s_national_soccer_team "United States women's national soccer team") winning most FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic tournaments. Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success,[\[92\]](#cite_note-94)[\[93\]](#cite_note-95) and the women's game has been improving in South America.[\[94\]](#cite_note-96)

Gameplay
--------

See also: [Parker's Piece](/wiki/Parker%27s_Piece "Parker's Piece")

One half of a professional football match (45 minutes) between Slovenian clubs [NK Nafta 1903](/wiki/NK_Nafta_1903 "NK Nafta 1903") and [NK Dob](/wiki/NK_Dob "NK Dob"). The score after the half is 0‚Äì0.

Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the [Laws of the Game](#Laws_of_the_Game). The game is played using a spherical ball of 68‚Äì70¬†cm (27‚Äì28¬†in) circumference,[\[95\]](#cite_note-97) known as the _[football](/wiki/Ball_\(association_football\) "Ball (association football)")_ (or _soccer ball_). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a [captain](/wiki/Captain_\(association_football\) "Captain (association football)") who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or [penalty kicks](/wiki/Penalty_kick_\(association_football\) "Penalty kick (association football)").[\[5\]](#cite_note-laws51-52-6)

The primary law is that players other than [goalkeepers](/wiki/Goalkeeper_\(association_football\) "Goalkeeper (association football)") may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a [throw-in](/wiki/Throw-in "Throw-in") restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, ["heading"](/wiki/Header_\(association_football\) "Header (association football)") with the forehead)[\[96\]](#cite_note-98) other than their hands or arms.[\[97\]](#cite_note-fouls-99) Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an [offside](/wiki/Offside_\(association_football\) "Offside (association football)") position.[\[98\]](#cite_note-offsidelaw-100)

During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by [dribbling](/wiki/Dribbling "Dribbling"), passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through [tackling](/wiki/Tackle_\(football_move\)#Association_football "Tackle (football move)") the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the [referee](/wiki/Referee_\(association_football\) "Referee (association football)") for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.[\[99\]](#cite_note-restart-101)

A player executing a slide [tackle](/wiki/Tackle_\(football_move\) "Tackle (football move)") to dispossess an opponent

At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the [2022‚Äì23 season](/wiki/2022%E2%80%9323_Premier_League "2022‚Äì23 Premier League") of the English [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League "Premier League") produced an average of 2.85 goals per match.[\[100\]](#cite_note-102) The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,[\[101\]](#cite_note-LAW301-103) but a number of [specialised roles](/wiki/Association_football_positions "Association football positions") have evolved.[\[102\]](#cite_note-104) Broadly, these include three main categories: [strikers](/wiki/Striker_\(association_football\) "Striker (association football)"), or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; [defenders](/wiki/Defender_\(association_football\) "Defender (association football)"), who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and [midfielders](/wiki/Midfielder "Midfielder"), who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper.

These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends the most time. For example, there are central defenders and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.[\[103\]](#cite_note-105) The layout of a team's players is known as a _[formation](/wiki/Formation_\(association_football\) "Formation (association football)")_. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's [manager](/wiki/Manager_\(association_football\) "Manager (association football)").[\[104\]](#cite_note-106)

Laws
----

"Rules of football" redirects here. For the rules of other football games, see [Football](/wiki/Football "Football").

Further information: [Laws of the Game (association football)](/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_\(association_football\) "Laws of the Game (association football)")

There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulations and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football for both sexes, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors and people with physical disabilities are permitted.[\[c\]](#cite_note-Variants-107) The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the IFAB.[\[105\]](#cite_note-108) In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of association football.[\[106\]](#cite_note-109)[\[107\]](#cite_note-110) Within the United States, [Major League Soccer](/wiki/Major_League_Soccer "Major League Soccer") used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s[\[108\]](#cite_note-111) and the [National Federation of State High School Associations](/wiki/National_Federation_of_State_High_School_Associations "National Federation of State High School Associations") and [National Collegiate Athletic Association](/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association "National Collegiate Athletic Association") still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.

The [referee](/wiki/Referee_\(association_football\) "Referee (association football)") officiates in a football match

Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding [substitutes](/wiki/Substitute_\(association_football\) "Substitute (association football)")), one of whom must be the [goalkeeper](/wiki/Goalkeeper_\(football\) "Goalkeeper (football)"). Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the [penalty area](/wiki/Penalty_area "Penalty area") in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of [positions](/wiki/Association_football_positions "Association football positions") in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are [strategically](/wiki/Sports_strategy "Sports strategy") placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.[\[101\]](#cite_note-LAW301-103)

The basic equipment or _[kit](/wiki/Kit_\(association_football\) "Kit (association football)")_ players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate [shin guards](/wiki/Shin_guard "Shin guard"). An [athletic supporter](/wiki/Jockstrap "Jockstrap") and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.[\[109\]](#cite_note-112)[\[110\]](#cite_note-113) [Headgear](/wiki/Association_football_headgear "Association football headgear") is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.[\[111\]](#cite_note-114) Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.[\[112\]](#cite_note-115)

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is five in 90 minutes,[\[113\]](#cite_note-116) with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time; the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in [friendly matches](/wiki/Friendly_matches "Friendly matches"). Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or [timewasting](/wiki/Timewasting "Timewasting") at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.[\[114\]](#cite_note-117) IFAB recommends "that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team". Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.[\[115\]](#cite_note-118)

A game is officiated by a [referee](/wiki/Referee_\(association_football\) "Referee (association football)"), who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two [assistant referees](/wiki/Assistant_referee_\(association_football\) "Assistant referee (association football)"). In many high-level games there is also a [fourth official](/wiki/Fourth_official "Fourth official") who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.[\[116\]](#cite_note-119)

[Goal line technology](/wiki/Goal_line_technology "Goal line technology") is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent controversy. [Video assistant referees](/wiki/Video_assistant_referee "Video assistant referee") (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.[\[117\]](#cite_note-protocol-120)

A typical Ball

The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70¬†cm (27 and 28¬†in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450¬†g (14 to 16¬†oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 [standard atmospheres](/wiki/Atmosphere_\(unit\) "Atmosphere (unit)") (8.5 and 15.6 [pounds per square inch](/wiki/Pound_per_square_inch "Pound per square inch")) at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.[\[118\]](#cite_note-121)[\[119\]](#cite_note-122)

### Pitch

Main article: [Football pitch](/wiki/Football_pitch "Football pitch")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Soccer_pitch_dimensions.png/220px-Soccer_pitch_dimensions.png)](/wiki/File:Soccer_pitch_dimensions.png)

Standard pitch measurements

As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within [IFAB](/wiki/IFAB "IFAB"), the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [imperial units](/wiki/Imperial_units "Imperial units"). The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [metric](/wiki/SI "SI") equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of [metrication](/wiki/Metrication "Metrication") (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.[\[120\]](#cite_note-123)

The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100‚Äì110¬†m (110‚Äì120¬†yd) and the width is in the range of 64‚Äì75¬†m (70‚Äì80¬†yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90‚Äì120¬†m (100‚Äì130¬†yd) in length and 45‚Äì90¬†m (50‚Äì100¬†yd) in width, provided the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105¬†m (115¬†yd) long and 68¬†m (74¬†yd) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;[\[121\]](#cite_note-124) however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.[\[122\]](#cite_note-125)

The longer boundary lines are _touchlines_, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are _goal lines_. A rectangular goal is positioned on each goal line, midway between the two touchlines.[\[123\]](#cite_note-126) The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32¬†m (24¬†ft) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44¬†m (8¬†ft) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.[\[124\]](#cite_note-127)

In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5¬†m (18¬†yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5¬†m (18¬†yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at [kick-offs](/wiki/Kick-off_\(association_football\) "Kick-off (association football)"), goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.[\[125\]](#cite_note-128)

### Duration and tie-breaking methods

#### 90-minute ordinary time

A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.[\[126\]](#cite_note-rule7.2-129) The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called "additional time" in FIFA documents,[\[127\]](#cite_note-130)[\[128\]](#cite_note-131) but is most commonly referred to as _stoppage time_ or _injury time_, while _lost time_ can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is [out of play](/wiki/Ball_in_and_out_of_play "Ball in and out of play"), and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of "effective playing time".[\[129\]](#cite_note-132)[\[130\]](#cite_note-133) The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half, the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.[\[126\]](#cite_note-rule7.2-129) Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between [Stoke](/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C. "Stoke City F.C.") and [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. "Aston Villa F.C."). Trailing 1‚Äì0 with two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty kick. Villa's goalkeeper deliberately kicked the ball out of play; by the time it was recovered, the clock had run out and the game was over, leaving Stoke unable to attempt the penalty.[\[131\]](#cite_note-134) The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until a penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed; thus, no game can end with an uncompleted penalty.[\[132\]](#cite_note-135)

Most knockout competitions use a [penalty shoot-out](/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_\(football\) "Penalty shoot-out (football)") to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw

In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required, various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke [replays](/wiki/Replay_\(sports\) "Replay (sports)").[\[133\]](#cite_note-136) A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of [penalty shoot-outs](/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_\(football\) "Penalty shoot-out (football)") (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament or be the champion. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament, with goals scored in a penalty shoot-out not making up part of the final score.[\[5\]](#cite_note-laws51-52-6)

In competitions using [two-legged matches](/wiki/Two-legged_match "Two-legged match"), each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the [away goals rule](/wiki/Away_goals_rule "Away goals rule") may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shoot-out are required.[\[5\]](#cite_note-laws51-52-6)

### Ball in and out of play

Main article: [Ball in and out of play](/wiki/Ball_in_and_out_of_play "Ball in and out of play")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Shunsuke1_20080622.jpg/220px-Shunsuke1_20080622.jpg)](/wiki/File:Shunsuke1_20080622.jpg)

A player takes a free kick, while the opposition form a "wall" to try to block the ball

Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are _ball in play_ and _ball out of play_. From the beginning of each [playing period](/wiki/Playing_period "Playing period") with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:

*   [Kick-off](/wiki/Kick-off_\(association_football\) "Kick-off (association football)"): following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.[\[99\]](#cite_note-restart-101)
*   [Throw-in](/wiki/Throw-in "Throw-in"): when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.[\[134\]](#cite_note-137)
*   [Goal kick](/wiki/Goal_kick "Goal kick"): when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.[\[135\]](#cite_note-138)
*   [Corner kick](/wiki/Corner_kick "Corner kick"): when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team; awarded to attacking team.[\[136\]](#cite_note-139)
*   [Indirect free kick](/wiki/Indirect_free_kick "Indirect free kick"): awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick.[\[137\]](#cite_note-freekick-140)
*   [Direct free kick](/wiki/Direct_free_kick "Direct free kick"): awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls.[\[137\]](#cite_note-freekick-140) A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.
*   [Penalty kick](/wiki/Penalty_kick_\(association_football\) "Penalty kick (association football)"): awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.[\[138\]](#cite_note-141)
*   [Dropped-ball](/wiki/Dropped-ball "Dropped-ball"): occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.[\[99\]](#cite_note-restart-101)

### Misconduct

Main article: [Foul (association football)](/wiki/Foul_\(association_football\) "Foul (association football)")

#### On-field

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Yellow_card.svg/100px-Yellow_card.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Yellow_card.svg)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Red_card.svg/100px-Red_card.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Red_card.svg)

Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and dismissed from the game with a red card. These colours were first introduced at the [1970 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/1970_FIFA_World_Cup "1970 FIFA World Cup") and used consistently since.

A [foul](/wiki/Foul_\(football\) "Foul (football)") occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a [direct free kick](/wiki/Direct_free_kick "Direct free kick") or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [indirect free kick](/wiki/Indirect_free_kick "Indirect free kick").[\[97\]](#cite_note-fouls-99)

The referee may punish a player's or substitute's [misconduct](/wiki/Misconduct_\(football\) "Misconduct (football)") by a caution ([yellow card](/wiki/Penalty_card "Penalty card")) or dismissal ([red card](/wiki/Penalty_card "Penalty card")). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been "booked", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute, substituted player, and to non-players such as managers and support staff.[\[97\]](#cite_note-fouls-99)[\[139\]](#cite_note-142)

Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage".[\[140\]](#cite_note-143) The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within "a few seconds". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.[\[141\]](#cite_note-144)

The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.[\[142\]](#cite_note-145) The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.

Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, [doping](/wiki/Doping_in_sport "Doping in sport"), [age fraud](/wiki/Age_fraud_in_association_football "Age fraud in association football") and [match fixing](/wiki/Match_fixing "Match fixing"). Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.[\[143\]](#cite_note-FAsuspensions-146) Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.[\[d\]](#cite_note-147) Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.[\[143\]](#cite_note-FAsuspensions-146)

Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, point deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the [English Football League](/wiki/English_Football_League "English Football League") deduct 12 points from any team that enters [financial administration](/wiki/Administration_\(British_football\) "Administration (British football)").[\[144\]](#cite_note-148) Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.

[Headquarters](/wiki/FIFA_headquarters "FIFA headquarters") of [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA "FIFA"), the world governing body of football

The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as [futsal](/wiki/Futsal "Futsal") and [beach soccer](/wiki/Beach_soccer "Beach soccer"))[\[c\]](#cite_note-Variants-107) is [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA "FIFA"). The FIFA headquarters are located in [Z√ºrich](/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Z√ºrich"), Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:[\[145\]](#cite_note-confeds-149)

*   [Asia](/wiki/Asia "Asia"): [Asian Football Confederation](/wiki/Asian_Football_Confederation "Asian Football Confederation") (AFC)
*   [Africa](/wiki/Africa "Africa"): [Confederation of African Football](/wiki/Confederation_of_African_Football "Confederation of African Football") (CAF)

National associations (or national federations) oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states (for example, the [Cameroonian Football Federation](/wiki/Cameroonian_Football_Federation "Cameroonian Football Federation") in Cameroon), but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example, the [Scottish Football Association](/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association "Scottish Football Association") in Scotland). 211 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.[\[145\]](#cite_note-confeds-149) Other national associations may be members of continental confederations but otherwise [not participate in FIFA competitions](/wiki/Non-FIFA_international_football "Non-FIFA international football").[\[146\]](#cite_note-150)

While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the IFAB, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.[\[49\]](#cite_note-FIFA-51)

The [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup") is the largest international competition in football and the world's most viewed sporting event

International competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties: competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues. _International football_, without qualification, most often refers to the former. In the case of international club competition, it is the country of origin of the clubs involved, not the nationalities of their players, that renders the competition international in nature.

The major international competition in football is the [World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup"), organised by FIFA. This competition has taken place every four years since [1930](/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup "1930 FIFA World Cup"), with the exception of the 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled because of [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). As of 2022, over 200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals.[\[147\]](#cite_note-151) The finals tournament, held every four years, involved 32 national teams (expanding to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament) competing over a four-week period.[\[148\]](#cite_note-152)[\[e\]](#cite_note-teams_number-153) The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the [Olympic Games](/wiki/Olympic_Games "Olympic Games"); the cumulative audience of all matches of the [2006 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup "2006 FIFA World Cup") was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the [final match](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_Final "2006 FIFA World Cup Final"), one-ninth of the entire population of the planet.[\[149\]](#cite_note-2006coverage-154)[\[150\]](#cite_note-155)[\[151\]](#cite_note-156)[\[152\]](#cite_note-157) The 1958 World Cup saw the emergence of [Pel√©](/wiki/Pel%C3%A9 "Pel√©") as a global sporting star, a period that coincided with "the explosive spread of television, which massively amplified his presence everywhere".[\[153\]](#cite_note-158) The current champions are [Argentina](/wiki/Argentinian_national_football_team "Argentinian national football team"), who won their third title at the [2022 tournament](/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup "2022 FIFA World Cup") in Qatar.[\[154\]](#cite_note-159) The [FIFA Women's World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "FIFA Women's World Cup") has been held every four years since [1991](/wiki/1991_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "1991 FIFA Women's World Cup"). Under the tournament's current format that was expanded in 2023, national teams vie for 31 slots in a three-year [qualification phase](/wiki/FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup_qualification "FIFA Women's World Cup qualification"), while the host nation's team enters automatically as the 32nd slot.[\[155\]](#cite_note-160) The current champions are [Spain](/wiki/Spain_women%27s_national_football_team "Spain women's national football team"), after winning their first title in the [2023 tournament](/wiki/2023_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "2023 FIFA Women's World Cup").[\[156\]](#cite_note-161)

There has been a [football tournament](/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics "Football at the Summer Olympics") at every [Summer Olympic Games](/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games "Summer Olympic Games") since [1900](/wiki/1900_Summer_Olympics "1900 Summer Olympics"), except at the 1932 games in [Los Angeles](/wiki/1932_Summer_Olympics "1932 Summer Olympics") when FIFA and the [IOC](/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee "International Olympic Committee") had disagreed over the status of amateur players.[\[157\]](#cite_note-162)[\[158\]](#cite_note-163) Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Wherebegan-50) As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the [Soviet Bloc](/wiki/Soviet_Bloc "Soviet Bloc") countries of [Eastern Europe](/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe"), where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between [1948](/wiki/1948_Summer_Olympics "1948 Summer Olympics") and [1980](/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics "1980 Summer Olympics"), 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden_men%27s_national_football_team "Sweden men's national football team") (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), [Denmark](/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team "Denmark national football team") (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and [Japan](/wiki/Japan_national_football_team "Japan national football team") (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the [1984 Los Angeles Games](/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics "1984 Summer Olympics"), the [IOC](/wiki/IOC "IOC") allowed professional players to compete. Since [1992](/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics "1992 Summer Olympics"), male competitors must be under 23 years old, although since [1996](/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics "1996 Summer Olympics"), three players over the age of 23 have been allowed per squad.[\[159\]](#cite_note-164) A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.[\[160\]](#cite_note-165)

After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the [European Championship](/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship "UEFA European Championship") (UEFA), the [Copa Am√©rica](/wiki/Copa_Am%C3%A9rica "Copa Am√©rica") (CONMEBOL), the [African Cup of Nations](/wiki/African_Cup_of_Nations "African Cup of Nations") (CAF), the [Asian Cup](/wiki/Asian_Cup "Asian Cup") (AFC), the [CONCACAF Gold Cup](/wiki/CONCACAF_Gold_Cup "CONCACAF Gold Cup") (CONCACAF) and the [OFC Men's Nations Cup](/wiki/OFC_Men%27s_Nations_Cup "OFC Men's Nations Cup") (OFC).[\[161\]](#cite_note-CBC-Continentals-166) These competitions are not strictly limited to members of the continental confederations, with guest teams from other continents sometimes invited to compete.[\[162\]](#cite_note-167) The [FIFA Confederations Cup](/wiki/FIFA_Confederations_Cup "FIFA Confederations Cup") was contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions, and the country which was hosting the next World Cup. This was generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and did not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself.[\[161\]](#cite_note-CBC-Continentals-166) The tournament was discontinued following the [2017 edition](/wiki/2017_FIFA_Confederations_Cup "2017 FIFA Confederations Cup") with its calendar slot replaced by an expanded [FIFA Club World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup "FIFA Club World Cup").[\[163\]](#cite_note-168) The [UEFA Nations League](/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League "UEFA Nations League") and the [CONCACAF Nations League](/wiki/CONCACAF_Nations_League "CONCACAF Nations League") were introduced in the late 2010s to replace international [friendlies](/wiki/Exhibition_match "Exhibition match") during the two-year cycle between major tournaments.[\[164\]](#cite_note-169)

The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example, the [UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League "UEFA Champions League") in Europe and the [Copa Libertadores](/wiki/Copa_Libertadores "Copa Libertadores") in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the [FIFA Club World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup "FIFA Club World Cup").[\[165\]](#cite_note-170)

Domestic competitions

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Forcejeo_Real_Madrid_-_FC_Barcelona.jpg/220px-Forcejeo_Real_Madrid_-_FC_Barcelona.jpg)](/wiki/File:Forcejeo_Real_Madrid_-_FC_Barcelona.jpg)

A 2009 Spanish [La Liga](/wiki/La_Liga "La Liga") match between [Real Madrid](/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F. "Real Madrid C.F.") and [Barcelona](/wiki/FC_Barcelona "FC Barcelona"). The fixture, known as _[El Cl√°sico](/wiki/El_Cl%C3%A1sico "El Cl√°sico")_, is one of the most renowned in sport.[\[166\]](#cite_note-171)

The governing bodies in each country operate [league systems](/wiki/League_system "League system") in a [domestic season](/wiki/Domestic_association_football_season "Domestic association football season"), normally comprising several [divisions](/wiki/Division_\(sport\) "Division (sport)"), in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into [tables](/wiki/Table_\(information\) "Table (information)"), placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a [round-robin tournament](/wiki/Round-robin_tournament "Round-robin tournament"). At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be [promoted](/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation "Promotion and relegation") to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are [relegated](/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation "Promotion and relegation") to a lower division.[\[167\]](#cite_note-172)

The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may also be eligible to play in [international club competitions](/wiki/List_of_association_football_competitions "List of association football competitions") in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named [Apertura and Clausura](/wiki/Apertura_and_Clausura "Apertura and Clausura") (Spanish for _Opening_ and _Closing_), awarding a champion for each.[\[168\]](#cite_note-173) Most countries supplement the league system with one or more "cup" competitions organised on a [knock-out](/wiki/Single_elimination_tournament "Single elimination tournament") basis. These include the [domestic cup](/wiki/Domestic_cup "Domestic cup"), which may be open to all eligible teams in a country's league system‚Äîboth professional and amateur‚Äîand is organised by the national federation.[\[169\]](#cite_note-174)

Some countries' top divisions feature highly-paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and many women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The [five top European leagues](/wiki/Big_Five_\(association_football\) "Big Five (association football)") ‚Äì [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League "Premier League") (England),[\[170\]](#cite_note-175) [Bundesliga](/wiki/Bundesliga "Bundesliga") (Germany), [La Liga](/wiki/La_Liga "La Liga") (Spain), [Serie A](/wiki/Serie_A "Serie A") (Italy), and [Ligue 1](/wiki/Ligue_1 "Ligue 1") (France) ‚Äì attract most of the world's best players and, during the 2006‚Äì07 season, each of these leagues had a total wage cost in excess of [‚Ç¨](/wiki/Euro_sign "Euro sign")600 million.[\[171\]](#cite_note-176)\[_[needs update](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers")_\] These leagues also generated a combined ‚Ç¨17.2¬†billion in revenue in the 2021‚Äì22 season from television contracts, matchday tickets, sponsorships, and other sources.[\[172\]](#cite_note-177)
