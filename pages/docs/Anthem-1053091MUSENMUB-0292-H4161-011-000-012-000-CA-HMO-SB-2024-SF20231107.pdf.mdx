<p>Summary of Benefits
Medicare coverage that goes beyond Original Medicare
·
Medicare Advantage plans cover everything Original Medicare covers —
Part A (hospital services) and Part B (medical services) — plus more.
·
Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans cover Medicare Part D
drugs and Part B drugs.
These are Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans. That means:
· You must choose a primary care physician (PCP) in the plan’s network of
doctors for covered services. Your PCP provides most of your medical
care, including routine care and hospitalizations. They can help you save
time and money by directing you to specialists when needed.
· Before you visit a specialist, we recommend you talk to your PCP first.
They know your health history and can help you find the right care.
Is your PCP in our plan’s network of doctors?
If you need to change your primary care physician (PCP), give us a call and
we’ll help. Doctors can join or leave the network at any time, so check if they’re
in-network with our Find a Doctor tool online. Just follow the steps below.
