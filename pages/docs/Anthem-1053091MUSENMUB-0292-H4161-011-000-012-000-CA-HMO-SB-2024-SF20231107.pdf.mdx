<p>Summary of Benefits
Medicare coverage that goes beyond Original Medicare
·
Medicare Advantage plans cover everything Original Medicare covers —
Part A (hospital services) and Part B (medical services) — plus more.
·
Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans cover Medicare Part D
drugs and Part B drugs.
These are Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans. That means:
· You must choose a primary care physician (PCP) in the plan’s network of
doctors for covered services. Your PCP provides most of your medical
care, including routine care and hospitalizations. They can help you save
time and money by directing you to specialists when needed.
· Before you visit a specialist, we recommend you talk to your PCP first.
They know your health history and can help you find the right care.
Is your PCP in our plan’s network of doctors?
If you need to change your primary care physician (PCP), give us a call and
we’ll help. Doctors can join or leave the network at any time, so check if they’re
in-network with our Find a Doctor tool online. Just follow the steps below.

your physical, emotional, and mental health needs. This step is the start of
a trusting and enduring relationship between you and your care team.

professional service you gave me. I have learned in the past that truly
good caring professional service is not what we young senior citizens
always get. The staff [at Carelon Health] made me feel like they really

Understanding the Benefits
Check box...
The Evidence of Coverage (EOC) provides a complete list of all coverage and services.
It is important to review plan coverage, costs, and benefits before you enroll. Visit
https://shop.anthem.com/medicare/ca or call 1-844-309-6996 to view a copy of the
EOC.
Check box...
Review the provider directory (or ask your doctor) to make sure the doctors you see now
are in the network. If they are not listed, it means you will likely have to select a new doctor.
Check box...
Review the pharmacy directory to make sure the pharmacy you use for any
prescription medicines is in the network. If the pharmacy is not listed, you will likely
have to select a new pharmacy for your prescriptions.
Check box...
Review the formulary to make sure your drugs are covered.
Understanding Important Rules
Check box...
Effect on Current Coverage. If you are currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan,
your current Medicare Advantage healthcare coverage will end once your new Medicare
Advantage coverage starts. If you have Tricare, your coverage may be affected once your
new Medicare Advantage coverage starts. Please contact Tricare for more information. If
you have a Medigap plan, once your Medicare Advantage coverage starts, you may want
to drop your Medigap policy because you will be paying for coverage you cannot use.
Check box...
In addition to your monthly plan premium, you must continue to pay your Medicare Part B
premium. This premium is normally taken out of your Social Security check each month.
Check box...
Benefits, premiums and/or copayments/co-insurance may change on January 1, 2025.
Check box...
Except in emergency or urgent situations, we do not cover services by out-of-network
providers (doctors who are not listed in the provider directory).</p>
