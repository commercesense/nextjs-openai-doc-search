### Additional Non-Cigna Healthcare Coverage Options

**Covered California**  
You can buy health insurance through Covered California. The State of California set up Covered California to help people and families, like you, find affordable health insurance. You can use Covered California if you do not have insurance through your employer, Medi-Cal or Medicare.

You must apply during an open or special enrollment period. The California Open Enrollment period for Off Exchange Plans starts November 1 of the preceding calendar year, through January 31 of the benefit year. If you have a life change such as marriage, divorce, a new child or loss of a job, you can apply during a special enrollment period.

Through Covered California, you may also get help paying for your health insurance:

*   Receive tax credits: You can use your tax credit to help pay your monthly premium.
*   Reduce your out of pocket costs: Out-of-pocket costs are how much you pay for things like going to the doctor or hospital or getting prescription drugs.
*   To qualify for help paying for insurance, you must:
*   Meet certain household income limits
*   Be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or be lawfully present in the U.S.
*   Other rules and requirements apply.

Medi-Cal Is Changing Too  
Free health insurance is available through Medi-Cal. Medi-Cal is California's health care program for people with low incomes. Starting in 2014, you can get Medi-Cal if:

*   You are less than 65 years old
*   Your income is low
*   You are a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or lawfully present in the U.S.

Your eligibility is based on your income. It is not based on how much money you have saved or if you own your own home. You do not have to be on public assistance to qualify for Medi-Cal. You can apply for Medi-Cal anytime.

To qualify for Medi-Cal if you are over 65, disabled or a refugee, other rules and requirements apply.

Medical Review of Requested Services or Supplies
------------------------------------------------

### Covered Expense

Covered Expenses are expenses for services or supplies which are not excluded from your benefit plan, are recommended by a Physician, and are Medically Necessary for the care and treatment of an Injury or a Sickness.

### Prior Authorization

Prior Authorization means the approval that must be received prior to services being rendered, in order for certain services and benefits to be covered expenses under your policy. The Prior Authorization review may include benefit verification and a clinical review to determine whether the service or supply is medically necessary. When you are seeking services or supplies from a contracted Cigna Healthcare Physician or other Provider, that provider will determine whether a prior authorization review is required and submit the service/supply request for a prior authorization decision. Approval decisions will be communicated to the Physician/Provider, and denial decisions will be communicated to you and the Physician/Provider in writing.

### Medically Necessary/Medical Necessity

Medically Necessary Covered Services and Supplies are those determined by the Medical Director to be:

*   required to diagnose or treat an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms;
*   in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice;
*   clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration;
*   not primarily for the convenience of the patient, Physician or other health care provider; and rendered in the least intensive setting that is appropriate for the delivery of the services and supplies. Where applicable, the Medical Director may compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative services, settings or supplies when determining least intensive setting.

### Open Access to Outpatient Benefits

For routine outpatient office visits for behavioral care with an in-network psychiatrist or therapist, you do not need to contact us before your treatment appointment. To find an in-network psychiatrist or therapist, use our online directory or call us at the number listed on your member benefit card.

Be sure you understand the difference between in-network and out-of-network coverage. Seeing an in-network psychiatrist or therapist means you'll pay less and do not have to file a claim for reimbursement of covered expenses. In addition, psychiatrists or therapists are required to be licensed and meet quality guidelines for behavioral health.

### Prior Benefit Authorization Required for Other Care

For any other type of behavioral care, you must contact us to pre-authorize benefit coverage to receive the maximum amount payment for your claims. Call the toll-free phone number on your health plan identification card to reach our staff. An Advocate or Care Manager will be happy to help. Have your insurance ID card number available when you call.

Our phones are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. When you contact us, you'll be connected with the staff who can best meet your needs. Our Customer Service and Advocate staff can answer benefit or network questions and our licensed Care Managers can help to select the type and level of care you need.

If you don't understand what is and isn't covered under your plan, please contact us. We can help explain your coverage, deductibles and copays, and tell you how to access the kind of care you need.

These complaints will be investigated by a clinician. If appropriate the complaint may go before a committee of physician reviewers.
